Currently, I am a first-year MSE in Computer Science graduate student at Johns Hopkins University(JHU). Before I came to the US, I have received my undergraduate degree, B.Eng in Cybersecurity, at Sichuan University, China.

I have a broad interest in the field of security. My main interests are in language-based security and (static and symbolic) program analysis tools. I am also a big fan of CTF! I am currently play with team Z0D1AC and theHackersCrew. In the competitions, I am mainly working on the pwn challenges, and sometimes I also try the web challenges.
