I am currently a senior student who major in Cybersecurity at Sichuan University, China. I am so excited that I was admitted by the MSE Computer Science program at the Johns Hopkins University and plan to move to Baltimore for my graduate study this fall.

I have a broad interest in the field of security. And my work is dedicated to driving cybersecurity to be smarter and more intelligent. Currently, I am working on the Knowledge Graph construction for the Threat Intelligence storage, sharing, and retrieval.
